In this project, I've employed five differnet sampling techniques on five different ML models to find out the ML model with the best accuracy.
First I imported the dataset (Creditcard_data.csv) , balanced out the data but undersampling the class column and further iterated the training and test data through  each ML model for sampling techinques one by one.

# ML models used here:
Models: RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, SVC, KNeighborsClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier

# Sampling tecniques used here:
Sampling Techniques: Simple Random Sampling, Systematic Sampling, Stratified Sampling, Cluster Sampling, Cross-Validation, Bootstrap Sampling
